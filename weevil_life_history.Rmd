The top two models are Survival ~ Sex and Survival ~ Sex + food quality. But, I don't think there is a real effect of food quality on adult survival. After accounting for adult sex, food quality has almost zero influence on adult survival. Probably driven solely by a few influential points that popped up for the lower food quality treatments (see plot of observed daily survival).

The estimates seem reasonable. The estimated survival probabilities are in line with the mean lifetimes shown in the first figure. 

### Thoughts

It is clear that the sex of adult weevils has an effect on survival and that resource quality probably doesn't. 
We should expect that females will have lower survival than males since they allocate more resources to reproduction. 
However, I think it is interesting that resource quality has such a weak effect on survival considering their biology; weevils don't require food after emerging as adults so adult weevils rely almost entirely on what they ingested as larvae. 

Hmm, Markus also recorded the start and end weight of each bean pellet, so we know how much each larvae consumed. 
Do larvae in poor quality beans eat more to compensate for the low nutrition? Not super important, but would be interesting to check out.

The next step is to investigate:

* development time using Kaplan-Meier analysis;
* eclosion success using logistic regression;
* egg laying using poisson regression;

as functions of food quality. 

Once I've done that I'll make population projection matrices with these estimates and compare them with Markus'.

# EDIT: compare constant and age-varying survival models
Note that "time" in these models is synonymous with age (in days), since the times are days since emergence.

It is obvious why the S(t) ~ model fits better than S ~ models. Weevil lifetimes is not well-described by the exponential distribution. This implies that population structure (adult age) may be important to explicitly model. However, I don't think it is reasonable to select the particular time-varying model I've fit here. Essentially, the model is an alternative way of encoding the information in the (non-stratified) data. This is why the "estimated" and observed survivals are exactly the same. I think it would be better I could use a model that doesn't assume risk is constant like the exponential assumption rather than using the S ~ time model. Or, alternatively, I could "chunk" the ages of weevils into intervals that make sense, e.g., 1 day old, 2-3 days, etc.

How do I do time to survival analysis for non-exponentially distributed lifetimes? The KM curve looks concave-down, there is probably a less parameter-rich model for survival times.

I think that modeling survival using a Weibull distribution would make sense. The Weibull distribution allows for risk that changes over time instead of remaining constant like in exponential case.

<!-- **Wait, why is S(t) not a decreasing function? This shouldn't be possible. ** -->

<!-- I'm plotting the "real" parameters from the S ~ time model fitted in MARK.  -->
<!-- According to the [known fate chapter](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/pdf/chap16.pdf) the MARK guidebook survival is modeled using a binomial survival model. -->

<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!-- \hat{S}(t) & = \Pi_{i = 1}^t \left( \frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i} \right) -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->

<!-- Where $\hat{S}(t)$ is the estimated probability of surviving more than $t$ units of time, $n_i$ is the total number at risk at the beginning of the interval, and $y_i$ is the number surviving to the end of the interval. -->

<!-- From its definition, this binomial survival function should be non-increasing. However, the mark estimates do not obey this. -->
